<h1>File Organiser</h1>
<p>This is a simple python program that organises files from "downloads folder" and "desktop folder". It runs always and is launched on boot up , which makes it a no brainer(Windows only for now)

  You can download the EXE file and add it to this path like so "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\fileOrganiser.exe"
